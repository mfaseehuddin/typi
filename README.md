    <p>Typi | A simple, fast and logical typing test</p>
  </div>

#### Introduction
I have taken many online typing tests and I have always found them to be annoying because when you are typing in real life, you don't type random text.

It is my hypothesis that typing random non interconnected text is slower than something that is already in your brain or is a sentence that is gramatically correct.

#### How it works
Typi is a simple typing test that uses a database of sentences that are gramatically correct and are interconnected. This means that the sentences are not random and are not just a bunch of words thrown together.

#### Development
This project is built with Gatsby and ReactJS in Typescript. It uses a simple API to get the sentences from a database. The Front End is completely static and is hosted on Hostinger.

#### Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, please feel free to do so. I am open to any suggestions and I am open to any pull requests.
